# why 33?

Because I see it everywhere, all the time.  It surfaced under the most uncanny
circumstances throughout my teenage years, and likewise later in my adult life.
I even have a guitar given to me by my parents as a gift in the 11th grade that
is 33 of 100 that were made.  I began playing guitar when I was 11 (3 x 11 is
33's prime factorization).  I came to know my first-born when I was 33.

It's also a fairly common number for all kinds of reasons.  I'm not into
numerology (At least I don't think so).  I prefer reason over rhyme, science
before pseudo-science, and suspicion against superstition.

Does it really mean anything?  Probably not. Most likely it's my special flavor
of crazy, but it's *my crazy*.  **That's why I chose the handle mkelley33** for
myself in addition to not being able to get "mkelley" (so surprised!)
on twitter, github, #IRC freenode, or pretty much anywhere except
places I've worked or very small website registrations.

Much for the same reasons above **I chose to name my business entity hack33**.
And if you see autism33, dotfiles33 (where this file originated), or other
monikers bearing the appendage 33, then I might be involved.

Plus it sounds cool and I don't speak [Leet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet)
so I couldn't make it any kewler.  I do enjoy hacking though, and now I'm
probably on some ridiculous list for saying so, but it's important
that [people know what the terms hacker, hack, and hacking really mean](),
because [words matter alot]().  I hack quite alot, and I hope to make some money
doing so under the guise of hack33â€”on the side at least. Thusly, hack33.

And so I conclude in the words of the great Stan Lee:
